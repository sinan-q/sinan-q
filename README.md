### Hi there, I'm Sinan 👋

I'm an electrical engineering student with a passion for Android development using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose with Kotlin. As a hobbyist developer, I enjoy creating sleek and user-friendly Android applications that leverage the latest technologies.

- 🌱 Currently learning and experimenting with Jetpack Compose for modern UI development.
- 💼 Actively contributing to open-source Android projects to enhance my skills and give back to the community.
- 🔧 Experienced in using various Android libraries and tools to build robust and efficient applications.
- 🎓 Studying electrical engineering, but coding and building apps is where my heart truly lies.

#### Some of my projects:

- [Youtify](https://github.com/sinan-q/Spotify2YT): Android app to convert Spotify playlists into Youtube Music playlist.
- More on the way. Stay tuned.
